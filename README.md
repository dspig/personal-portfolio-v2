Personal Portfolio Website
================================================
This is my personal web portfolio, built using the react, redux framework and bootstrap for the ui interfaces. You can view it online [here](https://brandon-achu.herokuapp.com/).

## Prerequisites
* Most of my scripts were setup to run with yarn so if using npm, simply substitute the relevant commands in the server directory package.json.

## Getting Started
* Just clone the repo and run npm install to add dependencies.
* Run 'npm run dev' to start up the webpack server and gulp watch on the client/src/components directory sass files.

## Built With
* Bootstrap 4
* React-Redux (frontend library used)
* Express (Server-side framework)
* Yarn (Dependency management)
