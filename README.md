## Description
This is my personal web portfolio, built using the react, redux framework and bootstrap for the ui interfaces. You can view it online [here](https://brandon-achu.herokuapp.com/).

It's still somewhat of a work in progress and I'll update with various new projects and optimizations.

## Usage
* Clone the repo, then run **npm start**
* Start watch on components directory for scss changes with **gulp watch**
* Startup webpack server with **npm start**
