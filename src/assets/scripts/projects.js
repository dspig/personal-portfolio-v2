I've been a long time customer of this local family business and one thing I noticed was how bland and messy their main website was. Given how well I loved their food I decided to spice up their website and possibly pitch the new design to them if they considered changing it. I tried to go minimilistic when choosing a design style and added subtle transitive animations to various elements to improve the UX flow."
