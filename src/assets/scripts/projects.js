    description: "This is a redesign of a local chinese delivery restaurant in my area called Szechuan D'lite. I've been a long time customer of this local family business and one thing I noticed was how bland and messy their main website was. Given how well I loved their food I decided to spice up their website and possibly pitch the new design to them if they considered changing it. I tried to go minimilistic when choosing a design style and added subtle transitive animations to various elements to improve the UX flow."

    description: "This was a feature of the web application that I worked on with another intern during my summer (2017) internship at Contactually. Contactually's flagship product is a CRM tool that aids users in fostering, growing and managing personal and professional relationships. This page of the application one part of our revamp of their referral system. We first converted the page's codebase from Backbone.js -> React-Redux, which improved scalability and speed. Then we implemented new features such as referral modals to improve visibility of the referral program with the goal of generating new leads for the product."

    description: "This app was one of the first projects I built while learning to code. It allows the user to quickly search up information on any topic of their choice and displays the top 10 relevant results on the screen. It utilizes wikipedia's open api to gather results and allows a very wide search criteria for the user. The application also highlights the main points of the returned data so finding the desired information is faster."
