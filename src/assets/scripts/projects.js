I've been a long time customer of this local family business and one thing I noticed was how bland and messy their main website was. Given how well I loved their food I decided to spice up their website and possibly pitch the new design to them if they considered changing it. I tried to go minimilistic when choosing a design style and added subtle transitive animations to various elements to improve the UX flow."

This page of the application one part of our revamp of their referral system. We first converted the page's codebase from Backbone.js -> React-Redux, which improved scalability and speed.
